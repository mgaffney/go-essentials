# Go Essentials


_Rob Pike's_ article "[Go at Google: Language Design in the Service of
Software Engineering](https://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article)" is
a must read for learning Go. He explains the very real problems they
were having at Google which lead them to create Go.

The book "[The Go Programming Language](http://www.gopl.io/)" by _Alan
Donovan_ and _Brian Kernighan_ is a must read. It is assumes you already
know how to program so it is very concise while still being very
readable. Overall, one of the best programming books I have read.

## Naming

Naming is always an important topic.
In Go, understanding how package names are used
is key to picking good names for your own packages.
The Go Blog's article
"[Package Names](https://blog.golang.org/package-names)"
is worth reading at least twice.

_Andrew Gerrand's_
"[What's in a name?](https://talks.golang.org/2014/names.slide)"
talk is also a good reference for Go's naming conventions including
"[length of variable names](https://talks.golang.org/2014/names.slide#5)".
Specific slides cover naming of:

- [Local variables](https://talks.golang.org/2014/names.slide#7)
- [Parameters](https://talks.golang.org/2014/names.slide#10)
- [Return values](https://talks.golang.org/2014/names.slide#11)
- [Receivers](https://talks.golang.org/2014/names.slide#12)
- [Interface Types](https://talks.golang.org/2014/names.slide#14)
- [Errors](https://talks.golang.org/2014/names.slide#15)
